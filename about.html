    Howdy, my name is Kyle M. Gager. Sometimes I feel like I have lived a few different lives. I grew up in South Florida and almost became "Florida man." A couple months after I turned 21, I moved to NYC with a suitcase and a month's rent, no friends, no family, no school and no job. Fifteen years later I left NYC as a bar consultant with an amazing wife. My wife Jesselyn Cook is an incredible journalist and recent first time author. Her first book "The Quiet Damage" is award winning and got her a Nieman fellowship at Harvard. During the pandemic my wife got pregnant while we were moving all over the country chasing the housing market. I pulled a trailer from NYC to LA, LA to Denver, and finally from Denver to ATL where we found a home. A couple weeks after moving into our new house, we went to Canada for a baby shower and my son Wyatt was born 10 weeks early at 2lbs 11oz. He was in the NICU in Canada for a few months before moving him back down to Georgia. Since then he has come a long way. He just turned two and he is doing fantasic!

Nowadays I'm a stay-at-home dad and I still consult part time. Being a dad is the greatest job ever! I love hanging out with my son all day, running around next to the Chattahoochee river behind our house, singing songs and just playing games. I love this kid so much!
