<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<h4>Idea 1 : Interactive puppet for toddler learning</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

My son loves to sing, he loves learning and he looooooves hand puppets. When I'm teaching him I will sometimes do it through a hand puppet with a silly voice. Right now we are working on his numbers and letters. However sometimes his thirst for knowlegde out lasts my energy to continue to do the puppet voice. I want to make a robot puppet who's mouth can move and can interact with my son to help to teach. And/or a puppet that can sing songs requested by him.

<h4>Idea 2 :  A cocktail marble run</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I've always wanted to make a vertical marble run that can make a cocktail. Probably something easy and stirred, like an Old-Fashioned or Manhattan.
